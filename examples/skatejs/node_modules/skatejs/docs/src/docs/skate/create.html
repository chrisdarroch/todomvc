  <h2><code>skate.create (name)</code></h2>
  <p>In order to get around <a href="/docs/native-polyfill-quirks.html">native / polyfill quirks</a>, and to provide a bit of sugar in how elements are created, Skate gives you a common way to create any type of element:</p>
  <noscript is="sk-code" lang="js">
    var myElement = skate.create('my-element');
  </noscript>
  <p>This is like <code>document.createElement()</code> except that it will <em>always</em> ensure your element is initialsed synchronously before returning. It also only ever requires one argument instead of making you remember which arguments - and in what order - need to be passed to <code>document.createElement()</code> depending on how your element was registered.</p>
