  <h2>Native / Polyfill Quirks</h2>
  <p>There's several things that are different about the way native vs polyfilled custom elements behave. For each of these inconsistencies, Skate offsers a way to help make them consistent and predicatble.</p>



  <h3 id="h3-element-lifecycle">Element Lifecycle</h3>
  <p>An element's lifecycle consists of three stages. The following describes the stages as they behave when using native custom elements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Created - when the element is created, or encountered by the parser.</li>
    <li>Attached - when the element is inserted into the DOM.</li>
    <li>Detached - when the element is removed from the DOM.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Polyfill Inconsistencies</h4>
  <p>When these lifecycle stages are polyfilled, they behave differently because Mutation Observers batch mutations and fire asynchronously. Mutation Observers also only fire when an element is inserted to the document, which means an element's lifecycle cannot be handled until after it has been inserted into the document and cannot be handled synchronously.</p>
  <p>When polyfilled, each lifecycle stage behaves as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Created - after the element is attached to the document for the first time but before the attached stage occurs.</li>
    <li>Attached - after the element is attached to the document.</li>
    <li>Detached - after the element is detached from the document.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="notice notice-info">This isn't just Skate specific; most, if not all, custom element polyfills have these quirks.</p>

  <h4>Created</h4>
  <p>The <code>created</code> callback is called synchronously in native custom elements and asynchronously when polyfilled.</p>
  <noscript is="sk-code" lang="js">
    // Native: called immediately (synchronous).
    // Polyfill: not called. Only called if inserted to the DOM (asynchronous).
    document.createElement('my-element');

    // Native: called immediately (synchronous).
    // Polyfill: called when the mutation observer fires (asynchronous).
    document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('my-element'));
    document.body.innerHTML = '<my-element></my-element>';

    // Native: called immediately (synchronous).
    // Polyfill: not called. Only called if inserted to the DOM (asynchronous).
    document.createElement('div').appendChild(document.createElement('my-element'));
    document.createElement('div').innerHTML = '<my-element></my-element>';
  </noscript>
  <p>In instances where an element is initialized asynchronously, or your definition is loaded after the element is already on the page, there may be a flash of un-styled content. For more information see the <a href="/docs/options/resolved-attribute.html"><code>resolvedAttribute</code> option</a>.</p>

  <h4>Attached</h4>
  <p>The <code>attached</code> callback is called synchronously in native custom elements and asynchronously when polyfilled.</p>
  <noscript is="sk-code" lang="js">
    // Native: called immediately (synchronous).
    // Polyfill: called when the mutation observer fires (asynchronous).
    var body = document.body;
    body.appendChild(document.createElement('my-element'));
    body.innerHTML = '<my-element></my-element>';

    // Native: never called. Only called if inserted to the DOM (synchronous).
    // Polyfill: never called. Only called if inserted to the DOM (asynchronous).
    var div = document.createElement('div');
    div.appendChild(document.createElement('my-element'));
    div.innerHTML = '<my-element></my-element>';
  </noscript>

  <h4>Detached</h4>
  <p>The <code>detached</code> callback is called synchronously in native custom elements and asynchronously when polyfilled.</p>
  <noscript is="sk-code" lang="js">
    // Native: called immediately (synchronous).
    // Polyfill: called when the mutation observer fires (asynchronous).
    var body = document.body;
    body.appendChild(document.createElement('my-element'));
    body.firstChild.remove();
    body.innerHTML = '<my-element></my-element>';
    body.innerHTML = '';

    // Native: never called. Only called if <div> is in the DOM (synchronous).
    // Polyfill: never called. Only called if <div> is in the DOM (asynchronous).
    var div = document.createElement('div');
    div.appendChild(document.createElement('my-element'));
    div.firstChild.remove();
    div.innerHTML = '<my-element></my-element>';
    div.innerHTML = '';
  </noscript>

  <h4>Workarounds</h4>
  <p>It's recommended that everywhere you'd normally use <code>document.createElement()</code> to create a custom element, that you instead use <a href="/docs/skate/create.html"><code>skate.create()</code></a>. It provides a consistent, cleaner and simpler API for creating elements.</p>
  <p>For places that you use <code>innerHTML</code> you may pass an HTML string to <a href="/docs/skate/create.html"><code>skate.create()</code></a> and it will create, initialise and return an element using the HTML instead of the element name.</p>
  <p>For all other scenarios where you need to ensure an element is initialised, use <a href="/docs/skate/init.html"><code>skate.init()</code></a>. It will ensure an element is synchronously initialised. If it's already been initialised, then it's a no-op.</p>



  <h3 id="h3-script-tags-cut-off-content">Script Tags Cut Off Content</h3>
  <p>There are some instances where your child list may not be complete during the created lifecycle. If you have this HTML:</p>
  <noscript is="sk-code">
    <my-element>
      <div first></div>
      <script second></script>
      <div third></div>
      <script fourth></script>
      <div fifth></script>
    </my-element>
  </noscript>

  <p>And this JavaScript gets executed before the HTML is processed by the parser:</p>
  <noscript is="sk-code" lang="js">
    document.registerElement('my-element', {
      prototype: Object.create(window.HTMLElement.prototype, {
        createdCallback: {
          value: function () {
            console.log(this.innerHTML);
          }
        }
      })
    });
  </noscript>

  <p>Your <code>createdCallback</code> would log:</p>
  <noscript is="sk-code">
    <div first></div>
    <script second></script>
  </noscript>

  <p>This is because the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/#dfn-base-element-queue">spec</a> says that a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25915634/difference-between-microtask-and-macrotask-within-an-event-loop-context?answertab=votes#tab-top">microtask</a> should be queued to process the element's lifecycle. When the the closing tag of the first <code>script</code> tag is encoutered, the microtask is processed. This causes the element's lifecycle to be invoked before the remaining HTML can be processed.</p>
  <p>Basically, when that HTML is put in the DOM, the parser goes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I need to process the list of unprocessed elements.</li>
    <li>Process <noscript is="sk-code" inline><div first /></noscript> then remove it from the list of unprocessed elements.</li>
    <li>Process <noscript is="sk-code" inline><script second /></noscript> then remove it from the list of unprocessed elements.</li>
    <li>I just encountered a closing <code>script</code> tag, execute current microtask.</li>
    <li>Go back to step 1 for the rest of the unprocessed elements.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="notice notice-info">If you try and reproduce this in something like JSBin, it may not work as they mess with the timing of when scripts get executed.</p>
