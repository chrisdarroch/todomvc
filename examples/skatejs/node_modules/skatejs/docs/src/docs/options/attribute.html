  <h2><code>options.attribute</code></h2>

  <p>A function that is called when an attribute is created, updated or removed.</p>
  <noscript is="sk-code" lang="js">
    skate('my-element', {
      attribute (name, oldvalue, newValue) {
        if (oldValue === null) {
          // created
        } else if (newValue === null) {
          // removed
        } else {
          // updated
        }
      }
    });
  </noscript>

  <p class="notice notice-info">In native custom elements, this is not invoked for attributes that exist on the element before it is upgraded. Skate fixes that so that it <em>is</em> in fact invoked for all attributes no matter if they existed before or were added after the element was upgraded.</p>
